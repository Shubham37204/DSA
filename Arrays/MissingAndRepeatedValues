Problem: Find Missing and Repeated Values

Statement:
You are given a 2D grid of size n × n containing numbers from 1 to n².
Each number appears exactly once except:
- One number appears twice (repeated)
- One number is missing

Return an array [a, b] where:
- a is the repeated number
- b is the missing number
