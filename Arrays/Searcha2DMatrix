Problem: Search a 2D Matrix

Statement:
You are given an m × n integer matrix with the following properties:
- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given a target value, return true if the target is in the matrix, otherwise return false.
You must write a solution in O(log(m × n)) time complexity.
