Problem: Palindrome Partitioning

Statement:
Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

- A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.
- Each partition must cover the entire string without overlap.
- Return all possible palindrome partitionings of the string.
- The order of substrings in a partition matters.

You may return the partitions in any order.
