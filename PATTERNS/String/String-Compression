Problem: String Compression

Statement:
Given an array of characters chars, compress it using the following algorithm:

- Begin with an empty string s.
- For each group of consecutive repeating characters in chars:
  - Append the character to s.
  - If the character repeats more than once, append the count.
- The compressed string should be stored back into chars.
- Return the new length of the array.

You must do this in-place with O(1) extra space.
