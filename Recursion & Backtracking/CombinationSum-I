Problem: Combination Sum

Statement:
Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of nums where the chosen numbers sum to target.

- Each number in nums may be chosen an unlimited number of times.
- A combination is valid if the sum of its elements equals target.
- Two combinations are considered different if the frequency of at least one number is different.
- The order of numbers in a combination does not matter.

You may return the combinations in any order.
