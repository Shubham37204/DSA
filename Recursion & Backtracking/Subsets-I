Problem: Subsets

Statement:
Given an array nums of unique integers, return all possible subsets of nums.

- A subset is a selection of elements from the array (possibly empty).
- Each element can either be included or excluded.
- Since all elements are unique, the solution set will not contain duplicate subsets.
- The order of subsets in the output does not matter.

Return all possible subsets.
