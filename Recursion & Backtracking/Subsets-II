Problem: Subsets II

Statement:
Given an integer array nums that may contain duplicate elements, return all possible subsets (the power set).

- A subset is a selection of elements from the array (possibly empty).
- The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
- Subsets may be returned in any order.
- The input array may contain duplicates, but each subset in the output must be unique.

Return all possible unique subsets.
