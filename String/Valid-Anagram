Problem: Valid Anagram
Statement:
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
typically using all the original letters exactly once.
You may assume the strings contain only lowercase English letters.
"""

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s, t):
        # If lengths differ, they cannot be anagrams
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        
        # Sort both strings and compare
        return sorted(s) == sorted(t)
